Background

Welcome to Pymaceuticals Inc., where we specialize in developing anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In this assignment, we analyze the results of a recent animal study focusing on potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a type of skin cancer. The study involved 249 mice treated with various drug regimens over 45 days, with tumor development tracked and measured.

Tasks and Objectives

This assignment is structured around exploring and visualizing the data to provide insights and summary statistics for a technical report. Here are the tasks involved:

1.	Data Preparation:
  o	Merge and clean data to ensure accuracy and remove any duplicates.
  o	Check for consistency in mouse data across time points.
2.	Summary Statistics:
  o	Calculate and present mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of tumor volume for each drug regimen.
3.	Bar Charts and Pie Charts:
  o	Create visual representations of total mouse counts per drug regimen using both Pandas and Matplotlib.
  o	Display the distribution of female versus male mice using both Pandas and Matplotlib.
4.	Quartiles, Outliers, and Box Plots:
  o	Identify potential outliers in final tumor volumes across selected treatment regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, Ceftamin).
  o	Visualize the distribution of final tumor volumes using box plots, highlighting any outliers.
5.	Line Plot and Scatter Plot:
  o	Generate a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a specific mouse treated with Capomulin.
  o	Create a scatter plot of mouse weight vs. average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen, and overlay a linear regression model.
6.	Correlation and Regression:
  o	Calculate the correlation coefficient between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.
  o	Plot a linear regression model on top of the scatter plot to visualize the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume.
